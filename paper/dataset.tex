\subsubsection{Hacking Google Trends}
\label{subsub:hackinggt}
\begin{itemize}
	\item google trends has no api unlike many other google services
	\item therefore, an analysis of the request url was done to send prepared requests for data collection
	\item some additional problems like max. number of requests, request blockade etc.
\end{itemize}
