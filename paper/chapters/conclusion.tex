\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:ausblick}
simplified approach reached xx\% of accuracy, therefore it would be worthwhile to enhance the current model by predicting ranges of values, e.g. 50 up or down etc.
as described in \ref{sec:architecture}, only minor changes would only be necessary
\begin{itemize}
	\item summarize the results (implementation? evaluation results?) 
	\item does it work? why? why not? 
	\item how could the current solution be improved? 
	\item possible further research? 
	\item how fast must it be. Finance is fast changing market
\end{itemize}
