\section{Abstract}
\label{sec:abstract}
Neural networks experienced a steep rise in popularity over the last years. One reason for this trend is the versatility of these networks. They are being deployed in many domains such as computer vision and pattern recognition, predictions, robotics and self-driving cars and many more. However, in the financial domain only a few scientific papers are published which aim to predict the stock course development. This may be due to the difficulty as stock prices are influenced by a multitude of seemingly unpredictable and uncorrelated factors. Nevertheless, the development of a stock course depends strongly on the actions of traders. 
\\
In this paper a possible correlation between google trends search terms and stock courses is assumed and examined by using deep learning methods. Previous to the investigation the basic idea and necessary background is explained in more detail. Subsequently, as deep learning methods strongly rely on the data fed into this system, the deployed datasets as well as the executed preprocessing are described. Next, an overall description of the project architecture, including the used deep learning model, is given. In a final chapter the previously described implementation of the stock prediction model is being evaluated according to its accuracy.
