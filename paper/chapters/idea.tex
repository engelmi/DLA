google trends to stocks
simplified approach: only predict if the stock will increase or decrease
prediction of exact values are likely to have 0\% success rate

However, one key characteristic of stocks is that they are strongly volatile. 
Describe concept of volatility: (\url{https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatilit%C3%A4t})
absolute volatility:
\begin{equation}
	change = Value_{t1} - Value_{t0}
\end{equation}
relative volatility:
\begin{equation}
change = \frac{Value_{t1} - Value_{t0}}{Value_{t0}}
\end{equation}
logarithmic volatility:
\begin{equation}
change = ln(Value_{t1}) - ln(Value_{t0}) = ln(\frac{Value_{t1}}{Value_{t0}})
\end{equation}


in conclusion -> simplified approach reached xx\% of accuracy, therefore it would be worthwhile to enhance the current model by predicting ranges of values, e.g. 50 up or down etc.
as described in \ref{sec:architecture}, only minor changes would only be necessary
