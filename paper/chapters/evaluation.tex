\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item describe how the implementation is being evaluated
	\item execute the evaluation
	\item describe and interpret the results
	\item  
	\item using k fold cross validation, even though it is not best practice to log the k-mean outside graph, but it was easy to implement
\end{itemize}
