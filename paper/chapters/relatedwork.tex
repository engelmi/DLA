+ stock market description: chaotic, volatile, complex and seemingly unpredictable
+ result: few research teams try to find a way to predict stock development
+ the hype of deep learning also triggered the research in the field of stock market prediction, as dl models find application in a huge variety of domains (so why not prediciton of stock prices)
+ however: older research only hit about 5\% accuracy at best, even more discouraging for future work
+ nevertheless: recent research work used the improving methods of dl by using RNN and RBFNN and therefore the accuracy was improved 

As a result of the stock market being chaotic, complex and volatile, there are few published research papers to facilitate the work for this paper. 

Nevertheless, the few scientific papers exists which try to predict stock market development. 


There are few published research papers in the fields of deep learning and neural networks regarding the prediction of price development. 
Additionally, most of the available research's results are discouraging. The accuracy of price prediction is quite low with about 5\%. 

Although the number of publications are few, the

In \cite{stockprediction01} the authors use a combination of (2D)2PCA + Deep Neural Network (DNN) and compare this model with the current state of the art (2D)2PCA + RBFNN. 

In \cite{stockprediction02} the authors have done some shit.
